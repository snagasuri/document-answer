## Important Notes - Backend

1. Virtual Environment:
   - Always use the Python 3.11 virtual environment for running scripts:
     ```bash
     source backend/venv311/bin/activate
     ```
   - All required dependencies are installed in this environment
   - The scripts will not work with the system Python or other virtual environments

2. Running the Interactive RAG:
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     ```bash
     source backend/venv311/bin/activate
     ```
   - Run the interactive script:
     ```bash
     python backend/scripts/interactive_rag.py
     ```
   - Select a document to process:
     * Option 1: law.pdf (large law textbook, 818 pages)
     * Option 2: oleve.pdf (shorter document for testing)
   - The script will process the selected document and store it in Pinecone
   - You can then ask questions about the document in the terminal

3. Embedding Models:
   - The system now uses Pinecone's llama-text-embed-v2 model for embeddings
   - A dedicated Pinecone index (rag-index-llama) with 1024 dimensions has been created
   - The embedding model provides high-quality semantic search capabilities
   - A fallback embedding method is available if the API is unavailable

4. Troubleshooting:
   - If you encounter "No relevant documents found" responses, check:
     * Pinecone index configuration (should be rag-index-llama with 1024 dimensions)
     * Query formulation (try to use terms that appear in the document)
     * Embedding generation (verify the API is working correctly)
   - For large documents, the system will automatically use page-by-page processing
   - The system includes detailed logging for debugging purposes

## Important Notes - Chat Functionality

1. MongoDB Setup:
   - MongoDB is used for storing chat history and session data
   - Collections: users, chat_sessions, chat_messages, token_usage
   - First, install MongoDB dependencies if not already installed:
     ```bash
     source backend/venv311/bin/activate
     python backend/scripts/install_mongodb_deps.py
     ```
   - Then initialize MongoDB collections with:
     ```bash
     python backend/scripts/init_mongodb.py
     ```

2. Testing Chat Functionality:
   - Two testing approaches available:
     ```bash
     # Quick testing with mock responses:
     python backend/scripts/test_chat_session.py
     
     # Full integration testing with real API:
     python backend/scripts/test_chat_session_simple.py
     ```
   - Both scripts verify:
     * MongoDB integration
     * Chat session management
     * Message handling
     * Token tracking
     * Context window management

3. LLM Service Testing:
   - Interactive testing available:
     ```bash
     python backend/scripts/interactive_rag.py
     ```
   - API-specific testing:
     ```bash
     python backend/scripts/test_llm_api.py
     ```
   - Component testing:
     ```bash
     python backend/scripts/test_rag_components.py
     ```

4. Testing Environment:
   - Always use Python 3.11 virtual environment
   - Ensure all API keys are properly configured in .env
   - MongoDB must be initialized first
   - Redis is optional (disabled in tests)
   - Pinecone connection required for vector operations

5. Common Issues and Solutions:
   - String formatting errors: Use the simplified LLM service
   - Token counting issues: Check model configuration
   - MongoDB connection: Run init_mongodb.py first
   - API rate limits: Add delays between requests
   - Memory usage: Use page-by-page processing for large documents
   - Database schema issues: Check column names in models match migration files
   - SQLAlchemy errors: Avoid using reserved keywords like 'metadata' for column names
   - Service health check failures: Check individual service connections in the health endpoint response

## Important Notes - Development Environment

1. Running the Development Environment:
   - Use the dev.py script to start the development environment:
     ```bash
     source backend/venv311/bin/activate
     python backend/scripts/dev.py start
     ```
   - This will:
     * Start PostgreSQL and Redis containers
     * Initialize the database schema
     * Seed test data
     * Start the backend server
     * Start the monitoring service
     * Start the frontend server (if enabled)

## Recent Updates (2/27/2025)

23. API Route Fixes:
    - Fixed API route mismatches between frontend and backend
    - Updated backend's main.py to register API routers with the prefix "/api/v1" instead of just "/api"
    - Updated frontend API routes to use the correct paths that match the backend routes:
      * Updated src/app/api/chat/[...path]/route.ts to use "/api/v1/chat/"
      * Updated src/app/api/documents/[...path]/route.ts to use "/api/v1/documents/"
      * Updated src/app/api/v1/[...path]/route.ts to use "/api/v1/"
    - These changes ensure that the frontend API routes correctly forward requests to the backend API routes

24. RAG Pipeline Improvements:
    - Added PineconeEmbeddingService class to use Pinecone's llama-text-embed-v2 model for embeddings
    - Modified HybridRetriever to load document chunks from MongoDB when initialized with a session_id
    - Updated add_documents method to use the PineconeEmbeddingService instead of SentenceTransformer
    - Updated vector_search method to use the PineconeEmbeddingService and create temporary chunks from metadata
    - These changes ensure that the RAG pipeline uses the same embedding model as the interactive_rag.py script
    - Added ability to create temporary DocumentChunk objects from Pinecone metadata when local documents aren't found

25. Current Issues and Fixes:
    - Fixed error in _load_documents_from_mongodb: "badly formed hexadecimal UUID string"
    - The issue was happening when trying to convert MongoDB document IDs to UUIDs
    - Fixed by using uuid.uuid5() to generate deterministic UUIDs from MongoDB ObjectId strings
    - Also fixed the same issue in the vector_search method when creating temporary chunks
    - Used uuid.NAMESPACE_OID as the namespace for generating UUIDs from ObjectId strings
    - Added better error handling in both methods to catch and log any UUID conversion errors

26. UUID Conversion and Error Handling Improvements:
    - Enhanced UUID conversion in HybridRetriever with robust error handling
    - Added try-except blocks around UUID generation to catch and handle conversion errors
    - Implemented fallback to uuid.uuid4() when deterministic UUID generation fails
    - Added detailed logging for UUID conversion errors to aid in debugging
    - Fixed the same issue in vector_search method when creating temporary chunks from metadata
    - Improved error messages to provide more context about the failure point
    - These changes ensure the system can continue functioning even when UUID conversion fails

27. Empty Results Handling in Reranker:
    - Fixed "invalid request: list of documents must not be empty" error in Cohere reranking
    - Added explicit checks for empty results lists in both rerank and rerank_hybrid methods
    - Implemented early return with empty list when no documents are available for reranking
    - Added warning logs to indicate when reranking is skipped due to empty results
    - This prevents API calls to Cohere when there are no documents to rerank
    - Improved error handling throughout the reranking process
    - These changes make the reranker more robust and prevent unnecessary API calls

28. DocumentChunk Object Handling Fix:
    - Fixed "DocumentChunk object has no attribute split" error in HybridRetriever
    - Updated BM25 initialization in _load_documents_from_mongodb method to use doc.content.split() instead of trying to split DocumentChunk objects directly
    - Made the same fix in add_documents method to ensure consistent behavior
    - This ensures proper tokenization of document content for BM25 search
    - The fix allows documents to be properly loaded from MongoDB and indexed for search
    - Improved error handling to provide more informative error messages
    - These changes ensure the RAG pipeline can properly process documents and perform searches

29. JSON Serialization Fix for UUID Objects:
    - Fixed "Object of type UUID is not JSON serializable" error in hybrid_search method
    - Added UUID conversion to strings before JSON serialization when caching results in Redis
    - Implemented a more robust serialization approach for SearchResult objects
    - Created a serializable_results list with properly converted UUID fields
    - Specifically handled 'id' and 'document_id' fields in chunk dictionaries
    - Added type checking to ensure only UUID objects are converted to strings
    - This fix ensures proper caching of search results in Redis and prevents serialization errors

2. Database Management:
   - Use manage_db.py for database operations:
     ```bash
     # Reset database (drop and recreate)
     python backend/scripts/manage_db.py reset_db
     
     # Run migrations
     python backend/scripts/manage_db.py migrate
     
     # Create new migration
     python backend/scripts/manage_db.py create_migration "description"
     
     # Export schema
     python backend/scripts/manage_db.py export_schema
     ```

3. Data Seeding:
   - Use run_seed.py for seeding test data:
     ```bash
     python backend/scripts/run_seed.py
     ```
   - This script has improved error handling and will continue even if some parts fail

4. Understanding dev.py:
   - The dev.py script is a comprehensive development environment orchestrator
   - It manages the entire development workflow in one command
   - Key responsibilities:
     * Starting and managing Docker containers (PostgreSQL, Redis)
     * Database initialization and migration
     * Test data generation and seeding
     * Starting the backend FastAPI server
     * Starting the monitoring service
     * Starting the frontend Next.js server
     * Health checking all services
     * Graceful shutdown of all components
   - The script is designed to provide a consistent development environment
   - It handles dependencies between services (e.g., ensuring database is ready before starting the backend)
   - It provides a single command to start the entire application stack
   - The script is not meant for production deployment, only for development

5. Docker Usage:
   - Docker is used to provide consistent, isolated environments for services
   - PostgreSQL and Redis are run in Docker containers to avoid installation conflicts
   - Docker Compose manages the container lifecycle and networking
   - The containers are configured with persistent volumes to preserve data between restarts
   - The backend and frontend services run directly on the host for easier debugging
   - This hybrid approach (containers for services, host for application code) provides the best development experience

## Recent Updates (2/27/2025 - RAG Response Fixes)

30. Fixed NaN Response Issue in Chat:
    - Identified and fixed the issue with the RAG application returning "NaN" responses
    - The problem had two main components:
      * Documents were being marked as "complete" before Pinecone had fully indexed the vectors
      * NaN values in token usage weren't being properly handled in the streaming response

31. Vector Verification Improvements in hybrid_retriever.py:
    - Completely rewrote the vector verification process to be more robust
    - Added exponential backoff with jitter for retry attempts
    - Modified the verification process to properly return False if vectors aren't searchable
    - Updated add_documents method to return a boolean indicating searchability status
    - Added detailed logging throughout the verification process
    - Implemented a test query mechanism to verify vectors are actually queryable
    - These changes ensure that vectors are truly searchable before being used

32. Document Status Handling Enhancements in documents.py:
    - Added new document status values: "indexed_not_searchable" and "indexing_failed"
    - Only marks documents as "complete" when vectors are verified as searchable
    - Added a retry mechanism that periodically checks if vectors become searchable
    - Uses asyncio tasks to handle background verification
    - Improved error handling and logging throughout the document processing pipeline
    - These changes prevent premature queries against vectors that aren't ready

33. NaN Handling in chat.py:
    - Added code to sanitize response values before sending to frontend
    - Replaces NaN values with sensible defaults (0 for token counts, 100000 for max tokens)
    - Ensures all numeric values are valid before JSON serialization
    - Added proper content field mapping for consistency
    - Implemented these fixes in both stream_session_response and stream_chat_response functions
    - These changes prevent JSON serialization issues in the frontend

34. Frontend Updates in DocumentList.tsx:
    - Updated the component to display the new document processing status values
    - Shows "Indexing..." status when vectors are uploaded but not yet searchable
    - Shows "Indexing Failed" if vectors couldn't be made searchable after retries
    - Keeps the chat input disabled until vectors are truly searchable
    - These changes provide better user feedback during document processing

35. Testing and Verification:
    - Verified that documents are only marked as "Ready" when their vectors are actually queryable
    - Confirmed the system properly handles the delay between vector upload and searchability
    - Tested that NaN values in the response are properly sanitized before reaching the frontend
    - Verified that the application now works correctly, with no more "NaN" responses in the chat interface
    - These improvements make the RAG application more robust and user-friendly

## Recent Updates (2/27/2025 - Citation and UI Improvements)

36. Citation System Fixes:
    - Fixed issues with citation indexing in the chat interface
    - Resolved the problem where citations were showing "Source content not available" for some sources
    - Identified and fixed the root cause: sources coming in different stream chunks weren't being properly accumulated
