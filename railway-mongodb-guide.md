# Railway MongoDB Connection Guide

## Understanding the Issue

You're currently trying to use the internal Railway MongoDB connection string:
```
mongodb://mongo:bYdzdTaKBPNiGLdKRLesohjsSvxbLhPU@mongodb.railway.internal:27017
```

This connection string is meant for services **within** the Railway network to connect to each other. It cannot be accessed from your local machine because `mongodb.railway.internal` is a hostname that only resolves within Railway's internal network.

## Solution

### For Local Testing

1. **Get the external connection string**:
   - Go to your Railway project dashboard
   - Click on your MongoDB service
   - Look for "Connect" or "Connection" tab
   - Find the external/public connection string (not the internal one)
   - It should look something like: `mongodb://mongo:password@containers-us-west-XXX.railway.app:PORT`

2. **Test with the external string**:
   ```bash
   python test_mongodb_connection.py "mongodb://mongo:password@containers-us-west-XXX.railway.app:PORT"
   ```

### For Railway Deployment

For your actual backend deployment on Railway, you should use the internal connection string as it's more secure and faster:

1. In your Railway project, set the environment variable for your backend service:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://mongo:bYdzdTaKBPNiGLdKRLesohjsSvxbLhPU@mongodb.railway.internal:27017/rag
   ```
   Note: I've added `/rag` to specify the database name.

2. If you need to specify a different database name, append it to the end of the URI:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://mongo:bYdzdTaKBPNiGLdKRLesohjsSvxbLhPU@mongodb.railway.internal:27017/test_database
   ```

## Additional Notes

- Make sure your MongoDB service in Railway is properly initialized and running
- The internal connection string is secure and should be used for your Railway backend service
- The external connection string is for testing from outside Railway but may require configuring network access
- If your Railway MongoDB doesn't provide an external connection, you may need to enable public networking in the service settings
